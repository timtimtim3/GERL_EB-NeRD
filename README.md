## Directory Structure
Ensure that you have the following directory structure in your home directory:

```
├── GERL
│ └── (GERL_EB-NeRD files and directories)
└── data
├── ebnerd_demo
│ └── (EB-NeRD demo dataset files)
├── ebnerd_small
│ └── (EB-NeRD small dataset files)
└── ebnerd_large
└── (EB-NeRD large dataset files)
```

To run you need a folder "data" in which you should put the "ebnerd_demo", "ebnerd_small", or "ebnerd_large" folders which should contain the EB-NeRD dataset. You can use any size of the dataset.
